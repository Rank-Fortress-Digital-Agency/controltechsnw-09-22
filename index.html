                    Ductless Mini-Split Heat Pump Service
                </h2>

                        <p>
                            Ductless mini-split heat pumps are a great way to heat and cool your home without requiring ductwork. They work by using a series of fans to move air around your home, which then circulates through the mini-split heat pump to either heat or cool the air. This makes them an excellent option for homes without existing ductwork or having their ductwork damaged somehow. Mini-split heat pumps can also be an excellent option for additions or new construction since they can be installed quickly and don’t require significant modifications to your home.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you’re thinking about getting a ductless mini-split heat pump for your home, it’s essential to make sure that you find a reputable and experienced contractor to install it. This type of system is very different from a traditional forced air system, so the installation must be done correctly to avoid any problems.
                        </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Once your ductless mini-split heat pump is installed, it must be serviced regularly to keep it running correctly. Heat pumps are generally very reliable, but like any other mechanical system, they can break down from time to time. By having your heat pump serviced regularly, you can be sure that it will be there when you need it and will continue to provide efficient heating and cooling for your home.

            <p>
                One of the most important aspects of your heating system is your thermostat. <a href="https://controltechsnw.com/hvac-indoor-air-quality-clackamas-or/">Thermostat service</a> includes an inspection of the unit as well as a calibration to ensure that it is accurate. This can help you save money on your energy bills and keep your home at a comfortable temperature all winter long.  If you have an older thermostat, it may need to be replaced. Newer models are more accurate and can save you money on your energy bills. A thermostat service can also help you switch to a programmable thermostat, which can save you even more money.
            </p>
            <p>
                Programmable thermostats allow you to set different temperatures for different times of the day. For example, you can set the temperature to be lower when you are asleep or away from home. This can save you a significant amount of money on your energy bills.
